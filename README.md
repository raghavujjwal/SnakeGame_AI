# SnakeGame_AI
Using reinforcement learning to make an AI agent play the snake game on its own.
If you want to play the game yourself then use game.py but if you want to see the agent play the game itself then use game_Vo.py along with model.py, agent.py and helper.py. Run the agent.py file to see this in action:)
